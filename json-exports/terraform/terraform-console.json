    "Description": "Starts an interactive console for experimenting with Terraform\n  interpolations.\n  This will open an interactive console that you can use to type\n  interpolations into and inspect their values. This command loads the\n  current state. This lets you explore and test interpolations before\n  using them in future configurations.\n  This command will never modify your state.\n  DIR can be set to a directory with a Terraform state to load. By\n  default, this will default to the current working directory."
