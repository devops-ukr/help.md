    "Description": "This command has subcommands for advanced state management.\n  These subcommands can be used to slice and dice the Terraform state.\n  This is sometimes necessary in advanced cases. For your safety, all\n  state management commands that modify the state create a timestamped\n  backup of the state prior to making modifications.\n  The structure and output of the commands is specifically tailored to work\n  well with the common Unix utilities such as grep, awk, etc. We recommend\n  using those tools to perform more advanced state tasks."
