    "Description": "This command will move an item matched by the address given to the\n destination address. This command can also move to a destination address\n in a completely different state file.\n This can be used for simple resource renaming, moving items to and from\n a module, moving entire modules, and more. And because this command can also\n move data to a completely new state, it can also be used for refactoring\n one configuration into multiple separately managed Terraform configurations.\n This command will output a backup copy of the state prior to saving any\n changes. The backup cannot be disabled. Due to the destructive nature\n of this command, backups are required.\n If you're moving an item to a different state file, a backup will be created\n for each state file."
