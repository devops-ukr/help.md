    "Description": "Outputs the visual execution graph of Terraform resources according to\n  configuration files in DIR (or the current directory if omitted).\n  The graph is outputted in DOT format. The typical program that can\n  read this format is GraphViz, but many web services are also available\n  to read this format.\n  The -type flag can be used to control the type of graph shown. Terraform\n  creates different graphs for different operations. See the options below\n  for the list of types supported. The default type is \"plan\" if a\n  configuration is given, and \"apply\" if a plan file is passed as an\n  argument."
